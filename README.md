## 05 Record searcher:
Run: ```python3 05recordsearch.py```

It will ask for Record type:
* **D**: Disc record
* **AI**: AI usage record
* **ND**: Non-Disc record

Next it will ask for username (case-sensitive)

After, it will ask for how many pages to search back, e.g if you write '5', it will search pages 1-5. You can also set this to '-1' to search all availible pages

### Example:
Input:
```
Enter record type (AI, D, ND): 'D'
Enter username of record to find (case sensitive): MrCoolCool

```
